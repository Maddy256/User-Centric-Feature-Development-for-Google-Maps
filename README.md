# User Centric Feature Development for Google Maps

## Overview
This project involved an in-depth strategic analysis of **Google Maps** with a focus on enhancing accessibility, usability, and user engagement, particularly in low-connectivity and high-demand regions. The analysis includes proposed features and strategies aimed at driving user growth and retention through user-centered improvements.

### Project Goals
- To analyze and identify user needs, market trends, and competitive positioning for Google Maps.
- To propose feature enhancements and solutions for real-time navigation, offline functionality, and personalized routing.
- To develop key metrics (KPIs) for tracking user growth, engagement, and feature adoption.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Predictive Traffic Modeling**: 
   - Leveraged machine learning models to identify traffic patterns and improve real-time navigation.
   - Proposed time-series models (e.g., LSTMs) for predicting traffic congestion, capturing daily and seasonal traffic variations.

2. **Enhanced Offline Functionality**:
   - Suggested offline map layers with turn-by-turn directions, points of interest, and real-time updates.
   - Developed a concept for selective download options to optimize storage and focus on high-importance areas.

3. **Safety and Personalization Features**:
   - Proposed "Safe Route" options based on local insights and user feedback, especially for nighttime travel.
   - Designed landmark-based navigation tailored to regions where landmark guidance is more effective than street names.

## Challenges Addressed
- **Traffic Prediction Limitations**: Addressed gaps in real-time traffic updates and proposed predictive capabilities for peak and holiday traffic patterns.
- **Offline Accessibility**: Tackled the limited offline functionality for rural or low-connectivity areas, enhancing travel planning in these regions.
- **Personalization of Navigation**: Improved user engagement by tailoring route options and including safety-focused routes based on user preferences.

---

## KPIs & Metrics
To measure the success of the proposed solutions, the following KPIs were recommended:
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU) Growth**: Especially in targeted regions to assess the appeal of new features.
- **Retention Rate**: To evaluate if personalized routes, safety options, and offline functionality contribute to long-term user engagement.
- **Offline Usage Time**: Average time users spend in offline mode, especially in rural and low-connectivity areas.
- **Safe Route Feature Adoption**: Frequency of safe route usage in high-risk or nighttime contexts.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Developed a user-centered feature roadmap for Google Maps, focusing on accessibility and usability in emerging markets.
- Identified key metrics for tracking user engagement and growth.
- Proposed feature innovations to enhance user satisfaction and retention through data-driven, region-specific insights.
